# MoonriSe
MoonriSe is an open-world Unity game featuring dynamic day and night cycles, farming, shops, and zombie enemies. Developed solo as the lead developer during my time as a laboratory assistant, this project showcases survival mechanics, resource management, and interactive gameplay. Built entirely by me with Unity Editor version 2021.3.0f1.
